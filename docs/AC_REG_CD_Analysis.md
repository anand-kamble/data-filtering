In our dataset, we have a column named FLEET, which has values 
```
-------------------- Available Fleet values --------------------
FLEET
737-NG      1005197
ERJ190       112964
737-MAX       86098
CFM56-7B        518
CF34            128
LEAP-1B          78
131-9B           16
APS2300           7
```

We can use this to do the initial categorization of the value, rather than using the tail numbers of the aircraft. Since number of aircrafts is around `133`, focusing on `FLEET` will be easier at the start.
